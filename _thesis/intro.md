The state of today's connected devices represents a rapidly changing problem space. Scenarios for those who seek to understand and control the vulnerabilities are multitude. Industry stakeholders, academic researchers and end-users all faced the possibility of being a step behind in this continuously growing environment.

When we talk interconnected devices these days we are most commonly referring to individual closed Networks or Cloud dispersed networks with the same catch-all phrase The Internet of Things for IOT.
 For the purpose of this writing we will take the definition in which a note is defined as a single device and an edge is the connection between it and another device.

 Further William Mark a clear distinction between a direct interface, the control unit, and an  IOT device that is at least one stage removed from the control. The control unit is the interface device that reaches out to the IOT to perform some action for a sequence of actions. A simple example is that Bob is exercising and beginning to lose stamina. Bob opens his phone to check his progress, his phone checks is connected smart-watch contains the pedometer and relays the information to Bob that he is looking for. In this instance the phone is the control unit but the roles could easily be, Bob might have previously set goals and routing his phone and then while exercising he checked his watch for progress.  In this case the phone is the IOT device node and the watches the control unit.
Current literature details and number of device connections teams with variations on terminology. Ubiquitous seems to be the recognitions for the need of a common terminology, better security and a standard for expansion.

1 emergent concept that is garnering a growing portion of research attention in the field of IOT is that of trust. Trust is most commonly used as a metric against which some future decisions made such decisions inevitably focus on security and safety. The security and safety of information, physical infrastructure, and even human life is a fundamental concern. The current scheme up remote security concerns consists of a pass-fail process or Authentication. It is not uncommon for the both of information sharing between two or more devices to be contingent on a single full check oh, the most common example is a certificate of trust. In order to explain the strengths and weaknesses in current practices we must first cover a brief history of encryption methods  and the terminology commonly used.

 Once we have a shared terminology will you be able to move into an overview and explanation of how these methods are and are not used, and what are the determining factors of Authentication. And their we will percent prevent a more detailed explanation/ example of what trust in machines looks like today.

 Equipped with an understanding of trust a machine and a more detailed explanation of IOT terminology we will be able to eliminate some of the challenges facing IOT today and some coming in the near future. There will be two important Concepts remaining before we can begin the process of creating a template for a better model of trust.

 First we must look at the concept of trust itself examining both Dynamic and numerical methods that have been created to model trust in humans.  The second concept will flow naturally from our discussion of trust in people and will be that of roll  awareness. By the time world awareness has been explained we will be ready to lay out the requirements that will be necessary to present a model of Our Own.

 The presentation of requirements will be completely dependent on our revised definition of dynamic trust in machines that interface IOT.  With definition and requirement in hand we will begin to outline what our conceptual model should look like and from there to the most likely starting point from the existing computational framework.
After which they will attempt to formulate a rational adaptation of our chosen computational framework, opting to separate each of the corps testable concepts with its closest adapted model.

 Finally we will assemble the constituent pieces combining models were applicable and creating a state machine capable of self-reference and self-edit.
