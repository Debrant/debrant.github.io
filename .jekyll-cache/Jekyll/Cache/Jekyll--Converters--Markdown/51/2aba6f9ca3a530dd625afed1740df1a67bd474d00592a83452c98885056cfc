<p>So everything looked great on http://localhost:4000, but after pushing up to my repo it looks like this.
<img src="/assets/owner/blog/body/oops.png" alt="No CSS" /></p>

<p>A review of the debug console eventually showed that the original repo was all http: and now my pages won‚Äôt display with mixed  content. A fast find and replace and I am up and running.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now I start to customize the style sheets and format of the template. You may remember, last time I said that I wanted to make the inline images display nicer than default with markdown. To do this I hoped over to https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp and read the first four entries and did the ‚ÄúHow To‚Äù exercise. I decided what I wanted was a nice, size restricted image with a few extras like padding. I made the following class in my main.css</p>

<pre><code class="language-CSS">inline-img {
 display:block;
 float: left;
 padding: 20px;
 max-width:25%;
 margin:5 5 1rem;
 border-radius:5px
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="next-time">Next time</h2>

<p>I am going to find a way to make all of the images in the slider gallery the same height, and then fix the search element</p>
