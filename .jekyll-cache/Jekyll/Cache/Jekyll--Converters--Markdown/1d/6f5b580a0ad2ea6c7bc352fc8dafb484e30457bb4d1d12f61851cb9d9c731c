<p>I have been meaning to add some personal pages to my Github anyway. So
 Jekyll has a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">Step-by-step-tutorial</a>, but wasn’t there yet, as I didn’t have <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>.</p>

<p>Since I have been doing a lot of Yocto and Buildroot work lately, I am on Ubuntu 16.04.5 and was able to follow the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/">Jekyll on Ubuntu</a> walk-through. After that it was back to the tutorial, which was by and large one of the easiest, but most helpful I have seen.</p>

<p>Next I looked for a cool <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">theme</a>, and fell in love with several, but my top two were <a href="https://taylantatli.github.io/Moon/">Moon</a> and <a href="http://madforjekyll.github.io/">MAD4Jekyll</a>. In the end I chose the MAD4Jekyll theme and found that I needed to install the  jekyll-paginate gem.</p>

<p>### Where does the build really happen?</p>

<p>It can be a little tricky figuring out where and how Jekyll is populating information when going from a very simple site (like in the tutorial) to a monster like MAD4Jekyll. My first attempts to get the MAD4Jekyll theme failed to pull over all of my edits.</p>

<p>I quickly realized is how easy it is to end up making changes in the wrong path. The _site folder is generated from sources when <strong>jekyll build</strong> or <strong>jekyll serve</strong> are issued.</p>
