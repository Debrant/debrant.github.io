Blue shadows race and glide through his mind.
Blue like her eyes that reflect midnight.
The silhouettes they cast form visions.
Eternal like mans' shadow instincts.
Shadows reflect figures long since dead.
They shine like the moonlight and reflect.
Reflecting lifetimes and love past spent.
She stands in the moonlight in dis arms.

It's brackish light cast out is lost in midnight of my eyes.
Through empty streets of darkness I search but do not find.
Of all the things gained by my light, it is to the darkness that I bind.
In this murky town of heat and night, beauty is lost to rot in crime.
If there is darkness that can save beauty, than it effort, I waste no time.
Now a gray-green smoke drifts loosely down these empty cobbled streets.
The moon and I smile crookedly and cast out on into the darkened heat.
