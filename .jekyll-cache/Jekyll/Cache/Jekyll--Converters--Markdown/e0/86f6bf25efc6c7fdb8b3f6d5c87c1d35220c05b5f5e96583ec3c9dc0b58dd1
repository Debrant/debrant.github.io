Each time a hoax, a sham, a shattered hope.
Each time I am left with the words that need to be spoken dangling from my lips.
Each time I wonder, will we ever make peace?
Understanding is all I want now, well, that and the piece of me you took.

  <p>In life, as in the garden, there are rare and beautiful blossoms that hold their fragrance (spirit) and form with grace until fading from this earth. The purpose for studying these forms is not toward recreation, for there was not, nor will there ever be another exactly like it, but rather toward enlightenment through its memory. It is through our memory of its beauty that we hope to reach its memories of self discovery.</p>

  <p>My teeth are the first I notice.
The crystallization of the senses ant a retardation of time.
It comes in a rush from the roots of all nature, from the forest, from the primal, undeniable rage.
It comes and I can only feel my teeth as they stretch and ache with the ancient memory of eyeteeth.
Now only the hunter remains, the world afresh.
All things sharp, clear and full of fragrance.
The scent of prey lingers in the air and my tongue recalls the taste of blood.
I begin to move now, changed, feeling only my teeth, I hunt.</p>

                the key of life
passport to All
                Somehow released
from petty thoughts
                from stupidity
A new leaf turned
                to turn this key
I have to look
                I have to find
me mine and all
                To hold this truth
I must give up
                ego and want
And just let you

  <p>a look my life has searched for <br />
a breathlessness in the hunger of the eyes <br />
heart and lungs with bitter hope <br />
happy-sad irony, this moment together <br />
what sacrifice could be too great to grant <br />
the courage to make this moment least <br />
but we continue on, passing by <br />
invigorated with this seed of hope  <br />
to slowly forget the magic that did not grow</p>

Blackened shriveled heart <br />
Pounding maniacally <br />
Heroically crests the summit <br />
to throw itself into despair</p>
