<h2><p>About Me</p></h2>

<div markdown="1">

### My name is Nathan Bryant,

#### I currently work as an embedded systems engineer for [TigerStop](https://www.tigerstop.com/), a world leader in automatic and stop gauge technology.  Our corporate charter is one that makes it easy to feel good about going into work everyday;

> ### Empowering local manufacturers to be globally competitive.

#### I have a B.S. in Electrical Engineering & Physics a joint degree made possible by cooperation between the [Maseeh College of Engineering & Computer Science](https://www.pdx.edu/cecs/home) and the Physics department of the [College of Liberal Arts & Sciences](https://www.pdx.edu/physics/) at  [PSU](https://www.pdx.edu)

#### I am currently finishing my masters thesis, and plan on defending it early in 2019. My thesis (title may change) is **A Dynamic model of trust for IOT Devices** tries to create a lightweight machine learning algorithm that will be capable of making situationally appropriate decisions other than just pass/ fail.

<h2><p>Professional Goals</p></h2>

<div markdown="1">
#### I was a late college student, having spent several decades (beginning in my teen years) working in the Food, Beverage and Entertainment industry. For many of those years, I would daylight in construction. First as a laborer, then as time progressed, a tradesmen in my own right. However a deep natural curiosity kept my love for science alive through those years and when the time came I made my move.

#### While it is true that I enjoy the work I do at TigerStop, my true passions are, and have been for years, much much smaller. Small as in nano-scale and smaller, Atomically Precise Manufacturing, in my opinion, will shape our future as a species. It will mean economic dominance for the country that achieves the first breakthroughs of real significance. I hope to have time after my thesis defense to begin applying for patents. I would welcome any serious discussion on the subject (just click the email button below).
