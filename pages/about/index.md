## Personal:
#### My name is Nathan Bryant, Technologist, Father, Husband, aspiring writer and reader of many things. I love stories, history and culture. I have been blessed with  freedoms that allowed me to travel extensively, wear many hats and redefine myself as needed along the way.

#### I have always loved story telling and exploring that craft is one of the main reasons I started this site. Along the way I decided it was also a good place to hold other things of interest that I am working on. I also have been using the site to explore Web Development and I am currently using Jekyll, a Ruby based, blog aware, static website maker. I will probably change the styling several times until I find my own way of doing things, but for the time being I have been hacking the Jeckyll theme [MAD4Jekyll](http://madforjekyll.github.io/).

#### I am still figuring out the best organizational scheme, but for the time being I am using the tags and categories to sort my writing. I am writing a story which for now I am calling Timelines, but you will also find random vignettes, side projects and poetry.

## Education:
#### I studied Electrical E ngineering & Physics locally at the  at  [PSU](https://www.pdx.edu) and am currently taking my time writing my thesis,   **"A Dynamic model of trust for IOT Devices."** In which I try to create a lightweight machine learning algorithm that will be capable of making situationally appropriate decisions other than just pass/ fail.


## Professional:

#### I am the Director of Research and Development at Precision Automation, a division of [TigerStop](https://www.tigerstop.com/). TigerStop is a world leader in automatic and stop gauge technology. Even so, our team of dedicated engineers in R&D work to expand our product lines into manufacturing markets in need of impactful and creative solutions. We believe that manufacturing is an essential cornerstone of a healthy community.  


#### As a non-traditional engineer I bring the insight gained through decades of experience across multiple industries. As a leader I strive to inspire creativity, flexibility and stewardship.
