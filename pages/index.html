<h1>Hi there, welcome to my website.</h1>

Even though the mission statement above, is from my employer, this site is strictly non-professional. It is here on my landing page because I find that it matters what you work for. My webpages however, are meant to be viewed for entertainment by  friends and family, and as such they are full of things that almost know one else would care about. But don't let that stop you from looking around.
